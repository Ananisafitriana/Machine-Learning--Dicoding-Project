# 🤖 Machine Learning Project: Clustering & Classification

Implemented an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow by performing Clustering on an unlabeled dataset to discover hidden patterns, followed by Classification modeling to generate predictive insights. The process involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to transform raw data into structured knowledge.

## 🔎 Project Overview

The workflow is structured into two main phases:

### 1️⃣ Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

- Applied clustering algorithms to segment the dataset into meaningful groups.
- Identified latent patterns and structural relationships within the data.
- Evaluated clustering performance using appropriate internal validation metrics.
- Interpreted cluster characteristics to extract domain-relevant insights.

This phase transforms unstructured data into structured group representations that can be analyzed further.

### 2️⃣ Classification (Supervised Learning)

- Utilized labeled data derived from clustering outcomes.
- Performed feature selection and feature engineering to improve predictive performance.
- Trained and evaluated classification models.
- Compared model performance using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Optimized the model to enhance generalization capability.

This phase converts discovered patterns into actionable predictive insights.
